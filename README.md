# 🏆 Mini Hackathon Challenge: Meta Landing Page

## The Challenge

Build a beautiful landing page that showcases how YOU build beautiful frontends with your AI coding agent.

The twist? You're using that very workflow to build it.

You have **one hour** to create a visually polished landing page that explains exactly how you built it. The page itself is proof of your process.

## Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] A visually impressive landing page (not the usual AI-generated stuff)
- [ ] At least 3 sections explaining your workflow
- [ ] Deployed with a shareable URL

### Your Page Should Answer
- What AI coding tools/setup do you use?
- How do you prompt for good design and styling?
- What is your strategy or process?

### To Help You Brainstorm
- Are you using the PIV loop to build the website?
- Are you giving examples of other websites or a color palette?
- Are you supplying brand guidelines as a skill?
- Are you using an MCP server like Figma or Browser Tools?
- Does your validation strategy include ways to validate the design?
- What are you doing for mobile responsiveness?
- How do you handle component organization and reusability?
- Are you using a UI library or going custom?
- How do you iterate when the first result isn't quite right?

### Bonus Points
- Distinctive visual style or theme
- Specific, actionable insights (not "I used Claude and it was good")
- Visual diagrams showing your process
- Personality — make it yours
