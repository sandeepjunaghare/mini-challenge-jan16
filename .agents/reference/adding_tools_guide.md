## Tool Docstrings for Agents

**Critical Difference:** Tool docstrings are read by LLMs during tool selection. They must guide the agent to choose the RIGHT tool, use it EFFICIENTLY, and compose tools into workflows.

### Philosophy: Write for Agent Comprehension

Standard Google-style docstrings document **what code does** for human developers.
Agent tool docstrings guide **when to use the tool and how** for LLM reasoning.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Guide Tool Selection** - Agent must choose this tool over alternatives
2. **Prevent Token Waste** - Steer toward efficient parameter choices
3. **Enable Composition** - Show how tool fits into multi-step workflows
4. **Set Expectations** - Explain performance characteristics and limitations
5. **Provide Examples** - Concrete usage with realistic data

### Required Elements (MUST Include)

Every agent tool docstring MUST include these sections in order:

#### 1. One-Line Summary

Clear statement of the tool's primary purpose.

#### 2. Use This When (Affirmative Guidance)

3-5 bullet points describing specific scenarios where this tool is the right choice.

#### 3. Do NOT Use This For (Negative Guidance)

**CRITICAL:** Tell agent when to use OTHER tools instead. Prevents tool confusion.

#### 4. Args (Parameter Guidance)

- Each parameter with type and description (standard Google-style)
- **PLUS:** Explain WHY you'd choose different values
- For enums: describe each option's use case
- For optional params: guidance on when to include vs omit

#### 5. Returns

What the tool returns (standard), **PLUS** format/structure details.

#### 6. Performance Notes (NEW - Required for Tools)

- Token usage for different configurations (minimal vs detailed)
- Typical execution time
- Resource limits (max file size, result count)
- Cost implications (API calls, database queries)

#### 7. Examples (Concrete Usage)

2-4 realistic examples showing:

- Simple common case
- Complex case with multiple parameters
- Edge case or important variation
- Use realistic paths/data (not "foo", "bar", "test.md")

### Template Structure

```python
@agent.tool
async def tool_name(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDependencies],
    param1: str,
    param2: int = 10,
    response_format: str = "concise"
) -> str:
    """[One-line summary of what this tool does].

    Use this when you need to:
    - [Specific scenario 1 where this tool is the right choice]
    - [Specific scenario 2]
    - [Specific scenario 3]

    Do NOT use this for:
    - [Scenario where OTHER_TOOL should be used instead]
    - [Scenario where ANOTHER_TOOL should be used instead]
    - [Anti-pattern or common misuse]

    Args:
        param1: [Standard description]
            Use this to [explain purpose and when to vary it].
        param2: [Standard description]. Range: 1-100.
            - Small values (1-10): [use case]
            - Medium values (10-50): [use case]
            - Large values (50+): [use case and warnings]
        response_format: Control output verbosity and token usage.
            - "minimal": [Description] (~50 tokens, use when [scenario])
            - "concise": [Description] (~150 tokens, default, balanced)
            - "detailed": [Description] (~1500+ tokens, use sparingly when [scenario])

    Returns:
        [Description of return value].
        Format: [Structure/format details that help agent parse].

    Performance Notes:
        - Minimal format: ~50 tokens (use for [scenario])
        - Concise format: ~150 tokens (default, good for most cases)
        - Detailed format: ~1500+ tokens (only when full content needed)
        - Typical execution time: [duration] for [scenario]
        - Max [resource limit]: [value] ([what happens if exceeded])
        - [Other performance characteristics]

    Examples:
        # [Brief description of what this example shows]
        tool_name(
            param1="projects/alpha.md",
            param2=5,
            response_format="minimal"
        )

        # [Description of complex case]
        tool_name(
            param1="research/ai-overview.md",
            param2=50,
            response_format="detailed"
        )

        # [Description of edge case or important variation]
        tool_name(
            param1="inbox/quick-note.md",
            param2=1,
            response_format="concise"
        )
    """
```

### Comparison: Standard vs Agent Tool Docstring

**❌ Standard Google-style (Insufficient for Agents):**

""" use below code as example template only

```python
def read_note(path: str, include_frontmatter: bool = True) -> str:
    """Read a note from the Obsidian vault.

    Args:
        path: Path to the note file.
        include_frontmatter: Whether to include YAML frontmatter.

    Returns:
        String containing the note content.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If note doesn't exist.
    """
```

**Problems:**

- No guidance on WHEN to use this vs other tools
- No token efficiency information
- No performance characteristics
- No examples with realistic data
- Agent doesn't know if this is for single notes or batches

**✅ Agent-Optimized Tool Docstring:**

```python
@agent.tool
async def obsidian_note_read(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDependencies],
    path: str,
    response_format: str = "concise"
) -> str:
    """Read a single note from the Obsidian vault with token-efficient formatting.

    Use this when you need to:
    - View the content of a SPECIFIC note you already know the path to
    - Check metadata (tags, status, dates) from frontmatter
    - Verify a note exists before performing other operations
    - Read content to inform a follow-up action (update, summarize)

    Do NOT use this for:
    - Finding notes (use obsidian_vault_query with search instead)
    - Reading MULTIPLE notes at once (use obsidian_vault_query with batch mode)
    - Analyzing note relationships (use obsidian_graph_analyze instead)
    - Just checking if a note exists (use response_format="minimal")

    Args:
        path: Relative path from vault root.
            Examples: "daily/2025-01-15.md", "projects/alpha.md", "inbox/ideas.md"
            Do NOT include vault path - just the relative path within the vault.
        response_format: Control output verbosity to save tokens.
            - "minimal": Title, tags, summary only (~50 tokens)
                Use when: Just need to check metadata or verify existence
            - "concise": Key metadata + content preview (~150 tokens)
                Use when: Need overview before deciding next action (DEFAULT)
            - "detailed": Full content with all frontmatter (~1500+ tokens)
                Use when: Need complete content for summarization or analysis

    Returns:
        Formatted markdown string with note content.
        Minimal: Title, tags, modified date
        Concise: Above + first 100 words of content
        Detailed: Full content with complete frontmatter section

    Performance Notes:
        - Minimal format: ~50 tokens (recommended for metadata checks)
        - Concise format: ~150 tokens (default, good balance)
        - Detailed format: ~1500+ tokens (use only when truly needed)
        - Execution time: 10-50ms for typical notes
        - Max file size: 10MB (raises error if exceeded)
        - Always prefer concise over detailed to conserve tokens

    Examples:
        # Check if daily note exists and get its tags (minimal)
        obsidian_note_read(
            path="daily/2025-01-15.md",
            response_format="minimal"
        )

        # Get overview of project note before updating (concise - default)
        obsidian_note_read(
            path="projects/website-redesign.md",
            response_format="concise"
        )

        # Read full research note for comprehensive analysis (detailed)
        obsidian_note_read(
            path="research/ai-safety-overview.md",
            response_format="detailed"
        )

        # Quick metadata check on meeting notes
        obsidian_note_read(
            path="meetings/2025-01-15-standup.md",
            response_format="minimal"
        )
    """
```

**Why This Works:**

- **"Use this when"** → Agent knows when to select this tool
- **"Do NOT use"** → Prevents tool confusion, directs to better alternatives
- **Parameter guidance** → Agent understands WHY to choose each format
- **Performance notes** → Agent can optimize for token efficiency
- **Realistic examples** → Shows concrete usage patterns the agent can follow
- **Token costs explicit** → Agent sees 50 vs 1500+ token difference clearly

### Common Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

**❌ Vague affirmative guidance:**

```python
"""Use this when you need to work with notes."""
```

Too generic. What KIND of work? Reading? Searching? Updating?

**✅ Specific affirmative guidance:**

```python
"""Use this when you need to:
- Read the content of a single known note
- Extract metadata from frontmatter for a specific file
- Verify a note exists at a specific path
"""
```

**❌ Missing negative guidance:**

```python
# No "Do NOT use this for" section
```

Agent doesn't know when to use other tools instead. High tool confusion risk.

**✅ Clear negative guidance:**

```python
"""Do NOT use this for:
- Searching for notes (use obsidian_vault_query instead)
- Batch reading (use obsidian_vault_query with batch mode)
- Graph analysis (use obsidian_graph_analyze instead)
"""
```

**❌ Toy examples:**

```python
"""Examples:
    read_note("test.md")
    read_note("foo.md", response_format="detailed")
"""
```

Unrealistic paths don't help agent understand real usage.

**✅ Realistic examples:**

```python
"""Examples:
    # Check daily note metadata
    read_note("daily/2025-01-15.md", response_format="minimal")

    # Get project overview before update
    read_note("projects/website-redesign.md", response_format="concise")
"""
```

**❌ No token/performance info:**

```python
"""Returns:
    String containing note content.
"""
```

Agent has no idea about token usage or cost.

**✅ Explicit performance characteristics:**

```python
"""Performance Notes:
    - Minimal format: ~50 tokens (use for metadata checks)
    - Concise format: ~150 tokens (default balance)
    - Detailed format: ~1500+ tokens (only when full content needed)
    - Max file size: 10MB
"""
```

### Writing Process: Think Like an Agent

When writing tool docstrings, ask yourself:

1. **Tool Selection**: "How will the agent know to choose THIS tool vs the 10 other available tools?"
   → Write specific "Use this when" scenarios

2. **Parameter Choices**: "How will the agent know which response_format to use?"
   → Explain token costs and use cases for each option

3. **Error Prevention**: "What mistakes will the agent make if I don't guide it?"
   → Add "Do NOT use" section pointing to correct alternatives

4. **Token Efficiency**: "How can I help the agent minimize token usage?"
   → Document token costs, recommend defaults, show format differences

5. **Composition**: "How does this tool fit into multi-step workflows?"
   → Examples showing tool in context of larger tasks

6. **Edge Cases**: "What will the agent do at boundaries (empty results, max limits)?"
   → Document limits and what happens when exceeded

### Tool Consolidation Principle

When multiple low-level operations can be combined, prefer consolidated tools:

**❌ Fragmented (requires agent to orchestrate):**

```python
read_note(path)      # Tool 1
patch_note(path, old, new)  # Tool 2
update_metadata(path, metadata)  # Tool 3
# Agent must call 3+ tools for simple "update note" task
```

**✅ Consolidated (single tool call):**

""" use below code as example template only

```python
obsidian_note_manage(
    path=path,
    operation="patch",  # or "read", "update", "append"
    find_replace=(old, new),
    metadata_updates=metadata
)
# Agent does everything in one call
```

Document the consolidation in tool description:

```python
"""Unified note management - handles read, write, patch, and metadata updates.

This consolidates what would otherwise require 3-4 separate tool calls.
Use operation parameter to specify what you want to do:
- "read": View note content
- "update": Replace entire content
- "patch": Find and replace text
- "append": Add to end of note
"""
```

### Testing Tool Docstrings

**Validate by asking:**

1. **Can an LLM select the right tool?**

   - Give agent a task and 5 tool options
   - Does it pick the right one based on docstrings?

2. **Can an LLM use parameters efficiently?**

   - Does it choose minimal over detailed when appropriate?
   - Does it understand when to use optional parameters?

3. **Does the agent avoid common mistakes?**
   - After reading "Do NOT use", does agent redirect correctly?
   - Does it compose tools properly in multi-step workflows?

**If agent consistently makes mistakes**, the docstring needs improvement, not the agent.

### Key Insight

Even small refinements to tool descriptions can yield dramatic improvements in agent performance. Invest time in tool docstrings—they are the CONTRACT between deterministic tools and non-deterministic agents. Clear contracts → better performance.
